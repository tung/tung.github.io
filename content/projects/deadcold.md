DeadCold is a science-fiction roguelike by Joseph Hewitt set in an abandoned space station overrun by monsters, malfunctioning robots and other lurking horrors.
The stranded player can take on one of ten different roles, each with their own specialties and weaknesses.
Offering necrology services, the player must navigate the different sectors of the DeadCold space station, parts of which have depressurized, to piece together clues from computer logs and journals if they are to have any hope of escaping alive.

## Source Code Restoration

With its initial release in 2001, DeadCold was one of Joseph Hewitt's earliest roguelike game releases.
However, its old GeoCities website wasn't going to be kept online forever, and neither was the ZIP of the source code that it was hosting.
I quite liked the atmosphere and theme of the game, so I decided to dust it off a bit to compile under modern versions of Free Pascal, and adapt it to behave better under Linux.
