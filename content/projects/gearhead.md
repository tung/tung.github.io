GearHead is a science-fiction roguelike game by Joseph Hewitt that takes place on Earth in the future where people pilot giant robots ("mechas").
It features extensive part-based mecha customization, giant robot and on-foot combat, a multi-faceted character skill system and a rich open world environment with randomly-generated quests and plots.

GearHead went on to spawn two sequels: [GearHead 2](https://gearhead.itch.io/gearhead-2), which takes the adventure into space, and [GearHead Caramel](https://gearhead.itch.io/gearhead-caramel), set in a world recovering from the apocalypse.

## My Contributions

I contributed a patch that improved the behavior of menus when using mouse navigation.
I also filled in flavor text descriptions for all of the items in the game, most of which would go on to find use in GearHead 2 as well.
