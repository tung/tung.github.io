chip8run is an interpreter (or "emulator") for CHIP-8: a bytecode format for the creation of video games for home computers made in the 1970s and 1980s like the COSMAC VIP.
CHIP-8 programs drive a 64-by-32 pixel monochrome display, while taking input from a 4-by-4 hexadecimal keyboard.
chip8run can run programs in the CHIP-8 format, often found with the `.ch8` suffix.
