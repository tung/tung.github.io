Dungeon Monkey Eternal is a party-based fantasy roguelike role-playing game by Joseph Hewitt.
The player controls a group of up to four adventurers that band together to take on quests that are randomly generated.
Gameplay takes place in a 2D isometric perspective with full support for mouse control.

Dungeon Monkey Eternal is the third game in a series begun with [Dungeon Monkey](http://roguebasin.com/index.php/Dungeon_Monkey) and [Dungeon Monkey Unlimited](http://roguebasin.com/index.php/Dungeon_Monkey_Unlimited).
The original Dungeon Monkey is notable for inspiring the annual [Seven Day Roguelike Challenge](http://roguebasin.com/index.php/Seven_Day_Roguelike_Challenge) in which aspiring roguelike developers try to create a complete roguelike in just seven days.

## My Personal Fork

I created a personal fork to implement a few minor enhancements:

- Recenter the screen on the party during and after moving.
- Center on NPCs when talking to them, and on enemies when combat begins.
- Store configuration files under `~/.config/dmeternal/` on Linux.
