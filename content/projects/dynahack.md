DynaHack is a variant of [NetHack](@/projects/nethack.md), the classic dungeon-delving roguelike experience.
It aims to modernize core aspects of the gameplay and interface by merging innovations from other NetHack variants with a broad swathe of minor improvements to many other aspects of the game.

The NetHack variants that influenced DynaHack the most are:

- [NitroHack](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/NitroHack): The technical foundation of DynaHack, to which it owes its enhanced resizable ASCII interface, ergonomic menu improvements and replay-capable logging save system.
- [UnNetHack](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/UnNetHack): The source of many new items, monsters, dungeon branches, special room types and shops, as well as changes and adjustments to gameplay systems too numerous to mention.
- [GruntHack](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/GruntHack): The source of magical "affixes" for otherwise mundane equipment, allowing the player to find things like a "short sword of fire" or a "small shield of stealth".

On top of combining the work of multiple NetHack variants into a single package, DynaHack includes a wide variety of refinements to the core NetHack gameplay that promote player exploration, experimentation and quality of life, while reducing stashing, backtracking and repetition.
