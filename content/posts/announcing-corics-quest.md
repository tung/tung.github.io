So here's the game I've been working on the the last six months: *Coric's Quest*!
It's a free and open source RPG that fits about two hours of game play into a single 9 MB file.
There are native builds for Windows and Linux, and a WebAssembly build that can be played in a web browser.

You can play it right now at [itch.io](https://tungtn.itch.io/corics-quest) and on its [homepage](https://tung.github.io/corics-quest/).
The source code can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/tung/corics-quest).
There's also a [project page](@/projects/corics-quest/index.md) here on this site.
